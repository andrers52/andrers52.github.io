- ** FIX ** call/remove takes too long to appear on the client

- add screeshot image to page (to appear in Twitter)
- add position information to client waiting page
- add mean waiting time to client's partner selection page

refactor
 - separate top bar into client/partner top bar
 - do not return json from client action -> redirect directly
 - deactivateQueue must set all clients status to 'Queue deactivated'
 (removed, has leaved, has been admited, is being called, has acknowledge call)
 - refactoring: queue should be a property of partner?
