            Cheap web hosting for solopreneurs.
        </h2>
        <p>
          This post is about my experiences and opinions on current alternatives to web development.
          
          It may make some sense to you in case you have the following constraints:
            - you have some application ideas you want to try out
            - you have minimal resources to be expended in financially non-viable projects, like 
              Minimal Viable Products (MVPs) or programming/scientific experiments you want to try out.

          That means: you know about web programming, and you want to publish your 
          own work for others to try and, perhaps, see some of these ideas become real products,
          you are also doing it alone, with your own money, no enterprise infrastructure to back
          you up (that is the 'solo' part in the title).

          If you're on this boat, or are curious about it, keep on reading! :)

          The constraints above apply to me. I'm willing to create software projects that are 
          profitable on the web.
          I had created already a multiplayer game, called Z32 which I developed
          in the old way: had an idea and started implementing it myself without much 
          interaction with other people. After about one year and a half I can say that it
          wasn't a financially successful product (Not yet! :)). So I decided to invert the process,
          implementing new ideas as Minimal Viable Products to test 
          them as early as possible, constantly interacting with my audience 
          during developent (I use Twitter. Please, follow me! :)), in order to receive valuable feedback
          that would help me direct my efforts to create products that people really want.

          For the game project, I used only JavaScript, both for client and server. I thought it would
          make sense to use NodeJS for the server side, since I would be using JavaScript already in 
          the browser I could reuse some parts of the code in the server.
          That was not exactly true until recently, when browsers started accepting "import". Before 
          that it was a bit complicated to reuse. But if you're willing to program in JavaScript it is 
          self-evident that you're ready to stand a beating.

          After developing the game, howhever, A had to deploy it. I could do it on Heroku, or Amazon, Google, Red Hat, Microsoft, etc.
          All these companies have offering of Platform as a service (PaaS) wich, at first, looks great:
          you do not need to care about infrastructure!!!! Let the experts do their job, for Christ sake! They even let you deploy your app for free!
          What's not to like? Well, the problem is. They charge for used resources, like an electricity bill. And it is not cheap...
          Resources to be charged are basically processing power and storage and, if you want to build some apps that are going to be used 
          by a user comunity before you have a user base big enough to financially suport it, you will need to finance their use yourself.
          That, for me, rules out the cloud alternative. Plus the fact that I want to own my software from top to bottom. But that is just me.** REPEAT THIS AS A QUOTE ***

          With that in mind I decided to try a cloud provider, like Data Ocean, Vultr, among others, where you can deploy adf Linux virtual machine yourself and set it up from
          scratch as you like it. I ended up chosing Vultr for the price and I have nothing to complain about them. 
          
          That was Ok for this one game project, were I was able to pick a $5/mo machine to start showing it while continuing development.

          
          -> Talk about using VULTR when it was just one project, and why, when I started to want to expand I had
          to move to PHP for finantial reasons.

          -> Talk about migrating to PHP hosting

          *** CONTINUE ***

          I had a couple of projects already and a social network 
          In this post I'll narrate my experience in deciding wich hosting plan
          to use.review web hosting alternatives to people who want 
          to create a web presence and applications that will need a 
          remote storage mediated by a REST API and also want to spend the 
          least amont of money.
        </p>

        <p> 
          This is a common scenario for people willing to create an on-line business, 
          or a portfolio of applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this case since there is no revenue yet, you'll want to minimize your
          expenditure, on the other hand, there will not be, at least in the beginning, a lot
          of traffic comming into your web application. The objective, by the way, is to
          grow past this stage, when you'll need to look for other alternatives 
          (this means you won!).

          <h1>Frameworks.</h1>
          To develop your applications you are going to need some supporting software.
          As a minimum, you'd need a REST API, in which case you could develop all the
          client interaction part in a Javascript Framework, like Angular, ou Vue.
          It would be interesting to have, on the other hand, more support in the server.
          One example of that is the support Ruby on Rails provides, for abstracting 
          the database access, allowing using several alternatives, and the modification 
          in the database structure (in RoR parlance "migrations"). The problem with that
          is the fact that these frameworks

          , which is 
          considerably costier.
          Another possibility is Django, with it's free admin web interface with crud,
          created for you just from the definition of your data model in the form of 
          Python classes. Nonetheless, it's support seems also to be a bit

          <blockquote>
            Although we have tested and run this Django configuration on 
            shared hosting accounts, it is not supported. You can use this
            configuration as a starting point for your own Django projects, 
            but A2 Hosting cannot help you troubleshoot or debug any custom
            configurations.

        <p>
          So, if you can settle for PHP and mySQL you can just select 
          the provider by price.
