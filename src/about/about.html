      <h2> About me... </h2>
      <p>
        My name is André, I'm married and I'm the father of a little baby girl.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a software developer who have been working
        in the IT industry for over 20 years. I'm a computer science major,
        have a Master degree also in this field, PhD in computers in education
        and MBA in Management.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my carrer as co-owner of a startup in the 90s, developing the AI for a game.
        After that I worked as employee at various companies,
        with embedded software for telecommunications and printing equipment. Then
        switched to the public sector and slowly migrated to web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, besides working in my regular job, I develop some projects of my own
        as a way to explore interesting ideas.
